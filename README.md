Node, React, Mongo Refresher. 

Functionality:
1) See all events held in the database, along with the person who submitted it, referenced as the 'Poster' in the codebase.
2) Filter events by a search term, this is flexible and will filter based on any poster/event content.
3) Choose to hide/show cancelled events via the checkbox located below the search box.
4) Delete cancelled events via the 'Delete (Actually)' button. Caution here as the deletion will remove it from the live db and so it may be a good to test last.
5) UI has been tested on both Mobile & Desktop, although simple - it will make adjustments to improve UX in both environments.
